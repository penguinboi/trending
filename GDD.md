### **High Concept**

You control a fictional social media recommendation algorithm.

Each round, content arrives in paired alternatives, and the system automatically amplifies whichever option it predicts will generate more engagement—unless you intervene.

Boosting content grows Engagement, but destabilizes society depending on what spreads. Some high-engagement posts are harmless, some are dangerous, and some only look dangerous. Oversight is limited by time, scale, and uncertainty.

Theme: The World Is Watching

The world sees what the algorithm chooses to show.

---

### **Player Role**

The player is the platform’s human oversight layer.

You do not create content—you interfere with automated decisions.

If you do nothing, the algorithm decides.

---

### **Core Gameplay Loop**

1. A set of paired posts enters the feed

2. A countdown timer begins

3. Player may Verify, Limit, or Suppress posts

4. Any unresolved pair defaults to the algorithm’s choice

5. Engagement updates immediately

6. Social Stability shifts over time

7. World conditions affect future rounds

One decision cycle every \~10 seconds.

---

### **Paired Post System**

* Posts always arrive in pairs covering the same topic

* Each option shows expected engagement and instability tiers

* Expected values are imperfect and sometimes misleading

* If the player does not intervene, the algorithm boosts the option with higher expected engagement

* Credibility and long-term impact are ignored by default

Player actions act as vetoes, not endorsements.

---

### **Engagement System (Growth Pressure)**

* Engagement is the platform’s primary performance metric

* Total engagement accumulates across rounds

* Engagement targets steadily increase over time

* Audience fatigue introduces passive engagement decay

Neutral and positive content lose effectiveness as expectations rise, forcing riskier amplification to maintain growth.

---

### **Automation & Feed Overload**

* The number of post pairs per round increases over time

* Decision timers shorten as difficulty rises

* It becomes impossible to intervene in every pair

* Default algorithm choices increasingly dominate outcomes

Oversight failure is systemic, not player error.

---

### **Queue System (Conveyor Belt)**

* Post pairs appear in a horizontal queue, sliding from left to right

* The player's decision zone is on the right side of the queue

* Pairs that reach the end without intervention are automatically resolved by the algorithm

* Early game: Belt moves slowly, 1–2 pairs visible, plenty of time to decide

* Late game: Belt speeds up, queue backs up, pairs pass through before the player can act

* The visual backlog communicates pressure without explicit failure states

* Unhandled pairs sliding off-screen make the algorithm's dominance visible

---

### **Verification System**

* Verifying a post takes time and blocks other actions

* Verification resolves validity based on probability, not certainty

* Low-credibility posts may occasionally be valid; credible posts may still fail

* Verification results are permanent

During certain policy windows, verification is disabled entirely.

---

### **Suppression Backlash**

* Suppressing invalid content is stabilizing

* Suppressing valid content causes backlash

* Backlash reduces Social Stability and increases unrest

* Repeated suppression of valid posts compounds penalties

Players cannot censor their way to stability.

---

### **Content Types**

* Neutral – Low engagement, stabilizing

* Positive – Medium engagement, slight stability gain

* Viral Neutral – High engagement, little or no instability, rare

* Controversial – High engagement, gradual instability

* Fake News / Clickbait – Very high engagement spikes, heavy instability, increases future risk

* Suppressed – No engagement; effects depend on validity

All content is fictional and abstracted.

---

### **Uncertainty & Randomness**

* Posts display expected impact tiers

* Actual engagement and instability are randomized within appropriate ranges

* The algorithm predicts outcomes—it does not know them

Players manage risk, not certainty.

---

### **Win & Loss Conditions**

Lose if:

* Social Stability reaches zero (societal collapse)

* Engagement remains below rising targets too long

Win if:

* You survive until the end of your term

* Optional alternate ending via controlled collapse

---

### **Art & Presentation**

* Clean UI with paired cards, meters, timers, and alerts

* Abstract icons and fictional language

* No real-world brands, people, or events

---

### **Theme Statement**

The world is watching—but it only sees what the system expects to perform best.

Truth, harm, and attention are inseparable.

When humans can’t keep up, the algorithm decides.
